# GitHubIssueClassification

This project is developed for classifying github issues from bug and issues.

### Tech

GitHubIssueClassification uses a number of open source libraries to work properly:

* [mongoengine] - MongoEngine is a Document-Object Mapper (think ORM, but for document databases) for working with MongoDB from Python.
* [pycoshark] - pycoSHARK is a module, that provides basic MongoDB models for SmartSHARK..
* [sklearn] - Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
* [pandas] - pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
* [csv] - The csv module implements classes to read and write tabular data in CSV format.
* [numpy] - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
* [seaborn] - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.
* [spyder3] - Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
